					Cataclysm
				</h2>
				"Though Lady Sylvanas and her Forsaken finally took vengeance
				upon their hated enemy, the Lich King, their dark crusade in
				Northrend proved costly. Betrayed by their Grand Apothecary,
				Putress, at the Battle of Wrathgate, the Forsaken's devious
				plague of death was unleashed on both the Alliance and the
				Horde to calamitous event. Unbeknownst to Sylvanas, Putress
				and his demonic ally, Varimathras, had taken control of the
				Undercity. As a result, the Forsaken were wrongly blamed for
				the traitor's atrocities. Though the Undercity was eventually
				retaken, Sylvanas and her followers still bear the weight of
				Putress's sins. Mistrusted by the other members of the Horde,
				the Forsaken must now prove their loyalty to the cause and
				redeem themselves from their supposed treachery. To this end,
				Sylvanas has bolstered her defenses within the Tirisfal Glades
				and readied her undead forces for any contingency. As one of the
				Forsaken, you must use your cunning and viciousness to slay any
				who would pose a threat to Sylvanas's rule be they human, undead,
				or otherwise."

					The Beginning
				</h2>
	
				"Bound to the iron will of the tyrant Lich King,
				the vast undead armies of the Scourge seek to eradicate all life
				on Azeroth. Led by the banshee Sylvanas Windrunner, a group of
				renegades broke away from the Scourge, and freed themselves of
				the Lich King's domination. Known by some as the Forsaken, this
				group fights a constant battle not only to retain their freedom
				from the Scourge, but also to slaughter those who would hunt them
				as monsters. With Sylvanas as their banshee queen, the Forsaken
				have built a dark stronghold beneath the ruins of Lordaeron’s former
				capital city. This hidden 'Undercity' forms a sprawling labyrinth
				that stretches beneath the haunted woods of the Tirisfal Glades.
				Though the very land is cursed, the zealous humans of the Scarlet
				Crusade still cling to their scattered holdings, obsessed with
				eradicating the undead and retaking their homeland. Convinced
				that the primitive races of the Horde can help them achieve victory
				over their enemies, the Forsaken have entered an alliance of
				convenience. Harboring no true loyalty for their new allies,
				they will go to any lengths to ensure their dark plans come
				to fruition. As one of the Forsaken, you must eliminate any who
				pose a threat to the new order – human, undead, or otherwise.
				Bound to the iron will of the tyrant Lich King, the vast undead

				from the Scourge in a small period of time when the Lich King lost
				some of his power, and freed themselves of the Lich King's domination.
				These renegades call themselves the Forsaken. They fight a constant
				battle not only to retain their freedom from the Scourge, but also
				to exterminate those who would hunt them as monsters.
